# How to run tests:

At first, download intern_cpp_hws/big_uint folder. \
Then, paste your code for addition and multiplication to BigUint.cpp file. \
Then you can try to pass some autotests. To run tests for multiplication – use test_mult.sh, to run tests for addition – use test_add.sh \
At last, you can send your code to me, and I will make a review. 

### PS:

To run a `__some_file__.sh` script, you need to write `bash __some_file__.sh` in your terminal!
