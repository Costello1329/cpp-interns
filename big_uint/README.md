# How to run tests:

At first, paste your code for addition and multiplication to BigUint.cpp file.
Then you can try to pass some autotests. To run tests for multiplication – use test_mult.sh, to run tests for addition – use test_add.sh
At last, you can send your code to me, and I will make a review.
