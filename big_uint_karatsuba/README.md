# How to run tests:

At first, [download](https://github.com/Costello1329/intern_cpp_hws/archive/master.zip) intern_cpp_hws/big_karatsuba_uint folder. \
Then, paste your code for subtraction and multiplication in BigUint.cpp file. \
Then you can try to pass some autotests. To run tests for multiplication – use test_mult.sh, to run tests for subtraction – use test_sub.sh \
At last, you can send your code to me, and I will make a review.

### Warning:
Do NOT modify any files, except BigUint.cpp.
Paste the code ONLY where I wrote a comment for you: `// Paste your code here:`

### PS:
To run a `__some_file__.sh` script, you need to write `bash __some_file__.sh` in your terminal.
